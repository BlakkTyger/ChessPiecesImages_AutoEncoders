# ChessPiecesImages_AutoEncoders

1) PreProcessed_Images_Random.zip is the zipped folder containing the preprocessed images
2) Reconstructed_Test_Images.zip contains the images reconstructed using the autoencoder on the test data. This contains 20 images.
3) Reconstructed_Train_Images.zip contains the images reconstructed using the autoencoder on the train data. This contains 100 images.

Note: 

a) All images were not taken into consideration to decrease the training time, and the number of epochs was also set to a low number (100) to increase the speed of training. Using more images and increasing the number of epochs will obviously lead to improvement in accuracy.

b) Input Dataset is not uploaded because of the large size of the zipped file.
