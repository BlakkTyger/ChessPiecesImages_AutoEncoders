# ChessPiecesImages_AutoEncoders

1) PreProcessed_Images_Random.zip is the zipped folder containing the preprocessed images
2) Reconstructed_Test_Images.zip contains the images reconstructed using the autoencoder on the test data. This contains 20 images.
3) Reconstructed_Train_Images.zip contains the images reconstructed using the autoencoder on the train data. This contains 100 images.

Note: All images were not taken into consideration to decrease the training time, and the number of epochs was also set to a low number (100) in order to increase speed of training. Using more images and increasing the number of epochs will obvious lead to improve in accuracy.
